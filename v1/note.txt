HTML NOTES
!aside is a secondary content.
!span makes the text in the same line.

block vs inline elements:
Block element: start from new line ex: <p>
            : it occupies its space
inline element: does not start from new line ex: <a> tag or <span>
              : in css, it only occupies what it needs
